# About Me

Hi, I'm glad you're looking at my profile. Let me tell you that I am a Fullstack developer who started learning a year ago with javascript. Why did I decide to learn it? Because I saw it in series and videos. From that moment I wanted to build my way into the It world. From the beginning until now I realized that this is for me, because I really like to use logic and creativity.
